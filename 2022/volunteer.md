## Roles

### Mentors to new speakers

JuliaCon 2020 will match first-time JuliaCon speakers desiring guidance to experienced speakers willing to mentor.
We are expecting a time commitment of maximally a few hours in which mentors will provide feedback on a novice speaker's presentation.

Please let us know if you would like to be mentored or if you are willing to mentor a first-time speaker for JuliaCon 2020!

### Proceedings reviewers

JuliaCon will be offering proceedings, and we need reviewers to assess submissions.
Our review process will be similar to that of the Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS).

### Virtual volunteers

Our virtual volunteers help keep the conference running smoothly by helping with items like registration, moderation, and AV support. Help us put on a great event for our community!
