# Code of Conduct

SciMLCon is dedicated to providing a positive conference experience for all attendees, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, or national and ethnic origin.
We encourage respectful and considerate interactions between attendees and do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. For example, offensive or sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference channel, including formal talks and networking between sessions.
In general, please abide by the [Julia Community Standards](https://julialang.org/community/standards/).
Conference participants violating these standards may be expelled from the conference at the discretion of the conference organizers.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

* Offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, or religion
* Sexual images in public spaces
* Sustained disruption of talks or other events
* Unwelcome sexual attention
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior

## Enforcement

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
If a participant engages in harassing behavior, event organizers retain the right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment for all participants.
This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the conference.
Event organizers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants.
We expect participants to follow these rules on all platforms used for conference interactions.
We think people should follow these rules outside event activities too!

## Reporting

If you would like to report a CoC violation or discuss any incident that may have left you uncomfortable, please contact one of the Discord admins (usernames in red) or organizers (usernames in blue).
They may involve other event staff to ensure your report is managed properly.
You won't be asked to confront anyone and we won't tell anyone who you are without your permission.
