# Memories of Juliacon past




### 2020

Juliacon moved online in 2020, and so we could not arrange the traditional group photo. We did however ask our attendees to upload a photo of the place they were joining from. Here is a collage, representing our global audience.

### 2019

The number of our attendees grew enough that we had to hire a drone to take the photo. Here we are in sunny Baltimore.

Juliacon moved to Europe for the first time. Here we are at the [front quad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCL_Main_Building) of the University College, London.

### 2015

With increasing interest, Juliacon was held at MIT, the home of Julia. Here we are, with the angles of the [Ghery's Stata Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stata_Center) behind us.

### 2014

The first Juliacon was held in Chicago, where nearly 80 early adopters came together to talk about this then new programming language. The rest is history!
