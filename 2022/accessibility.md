# Accessibility at SciMLCon

SciMLCon is committed to providing an accessible and inclusive environment to every attendee.

We will strive to ensure that the online platforms are compatible with screen
readers, and we shall attempt to close caption all our talks.

Please reach out to the organising committee at \email for any additional concerns.
