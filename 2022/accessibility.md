# Accessibility at JuliaCon

SciMLCon is committed to providing an accessible and inclusive environment to every attendee.
In light of our [announcement](/2020/covid19/) to shift JuliaCon online, our accessibility plans for this year are likely to be very different from prior events.

We will strive to ensure that the online platforms are compatible with screen
readers, and we shall attempt to close caption all our talks.

Please reach out to the organising committee at \email for any additional concerns.
