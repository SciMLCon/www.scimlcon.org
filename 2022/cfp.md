# Call for Proposals

The [Call for Proposals (CFP) is currently open](https://pretalx.com/scimlcon2022/cfp) and closes January 31st.

We are interested in all topics that have to do with SciML, including but not limited to topics such as:

- Core package development (DifferentialEquations.jl, DiffEqFlux.jl, NeuralPDE.jl, etc.)
- Developments in SciML-adjacent packages (automatic differentiation, numerical linear algebra, analytics and visualization, optimization, etc.)
- Downstream package development (applications packages, PDE solvers developed on SciML packages, etc.)
- Applications of SciML software in sciences (biology, bioinformatics, health, medicine, finance, economics, physics, chemistry, etc.)
- Compiler and performance analyses, benchmarks
- Tutorials teaching and demonstrating the use of SciML software
- Discussions of software engineering and best practices for SciML use
- Benchmarking of SciML software in applications or between methods
- Use of SciML in industrial applications
- Novel scientific computing and SciML methodologies being prototyped in Julia

The most important consideration is whether the topic would be interesting to the SciML Open Source Software community. 

Talks are 20 minutes long, including 5 minutes allocated for questions from the audience.

## Proposal Advice

- When thinking about what makes a good topic, ask yourself what kind of presentation would make you or your friends excited.
- Talk about your own experiences. You could tell us how you use Julia in your work or for a project.
- We are interested in both innovations you developed and restrictions you encountered in Julia.
- It may be a good idea to review previous JuliaCon presentations for inspiration and ideas.
- If you are presenting about a certain project, package, or company, include links to guide the reader to more information.
- Proposals must be in clear English. Please seek help from mentors or other community members if you feel you need to!
- Try not to assume familiarity with your subject when writing the abstract; the average reader is most likely not an expert in your area of expertise.
- Avoid opaque titles; while witty titles are good, an informative title is essential. Note you will have a chance to tweak the title after being accepted.
- Avoid infomercials; while we love to hear how you use SciML in your company, SciMLCon is not the place to sell your product.
- If you want feedback before submitting a proposal or if you are interested in the mentorship program, contact us at \email well ahead of the deadline.  If you are interested in mentoring, please also email us.

If you have doubts about becoming a speaker, check out the website [We are all awesome](http://weareallaweso.me/). 

We look forward to your proposals and to seeing you at SciMLCon 2022!

## Submission process

We are using an anonymized submissions process, to avoid selection bias related to the speaker.
While enforcing double blind is impossible since most submissions should link to public open source code, all efforts are made to ensure impartial review of submissions.
The [CFP is currently live](https://pretalx.com/scimlcon2022/cfp) and you can find more details on the review proccess, ways to create a strong proposal, and more there!

## Recordings and materials

We plan to video record all talks and will make them available after the conference. We do this for those who cannot attend.
However, if you are uncomfortable with having your talk recorded, please contact \email; being recorded is not a requirement to attend SciMLCon or to give a presentation.
Finally, we also ask you to make your materials and recording available under a Creative Commons (default: no commercial reuse) or other open source license.
